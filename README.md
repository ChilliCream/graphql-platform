**Hot Chocolate is a GraphQL Server for _.net core_ and _.net classic_**

_Hot Chocolate_ is a GraphQL server and parser implementation based on the current GraphQL [draft specification](http://facebook.github.io/graphql/draft/) defined by facebook.

## Getting Started

If you are just getting started with GraphQL a good way to learn is visiting [GraphQL.org](https://graphql.org).
The GraphQL specification and more is available in the [Facebook GraphQL repository](https://github.com/facebook/graphql).

##Â Using Hot Chocolate

The easiest way to get a feel for the API is to walk through our README example. But you can also visit our [documentation](http://hotchocolate.io) for a deep dive.

_We use for our examples .net core which you can download [here](https://dot.net)._

```bash
mkdir graphql-demo
cd graphql-demo
dotnet new console -n graphql-console
```

_Hot Chocolate_ can build a GraphQL type schema, serve queries against that type schema and host that time schema for web requests.

First, we will setup a GraphQL type schema which describes the capabilities of your API. _Hot Chocolate_ allows you to do that 
code-first by defining .net classes or schema-first by defining the schema in the GraphQL syntax and bidning types or just simple methods to it. Our walkthrough shows you the code-first approache.

```csharp
public class Query
    : ObjectType
{
    protected override void Configure(IObjectTypeDescriptor<IType> descriptor)
    {
        descriptor.Field("hello").Resolver(() => "world");
    }
}

public class Programm 
{
    public static Main(string[] args)
    {
        var schema = Schema.Create(c => c.RegisterQuery<Query>());
    }

}
```

The code above defines a simple schema with one type and one field that returns a string.
The schema would look like this:

```graphql
type {
  hello: String
}
```



Then, serve the result of a query against that type schema.
