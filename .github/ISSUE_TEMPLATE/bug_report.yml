        **Before you start...**

        This form is only for submitting bug reports. If you have a usage question
        or are unsure if this is really a bug, make sure to:

        - Read the [documentation](https://chillicream.com/docs)
        - Ask on [Slack](https://slack.chillicream.com/)
        - Look for / ask questions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/hotchocolate)

        Also try to search for your issue &ndash; it may have already been answered or even fixed in the main branch.
        However, if you find that an old, closed issue still persists in the latest version,
        you should open a new issue using the form below, instead of commenting on the old issue.
