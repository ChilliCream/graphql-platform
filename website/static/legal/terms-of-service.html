<h3>Use of the Services</h3>

<h4>Right to Use Banana Cake Pop</h4>
<p>
  ChilliCream Inc. grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable,
  non-sublicensable right to use the software application Banana Cake Pop on
  your computer. That right will terminate on any violation of these Terms of
  Service.
</p>

<h3>Third party software</h3>
<p>
  ChilliCream Inc. Services contain third party code and libraries licensed to
  us. That includes open source software, of which your right to their use shall
  be governed by their license agreement instead of this Terms of Service
  document.
</p>

<h3>Previews</h3>
<p>
  ChilliCream Inc. may release preview versions of our Services for evaluation
  and testing to you. These come as-is, with no guarantees, and may be removed
  or modified without notice. Their use is entirely at your own risk, and you
  accept that these versions may not have been subject to the same security
  checks, compatibility, stability and so on as non-preview versions of our
  Services. You should not use them in production environments or environments
  with sensitive data.
</p>

<h3>Intellectual Property</h3>
<p>
  The intellectual property in the materials contained in the Services are owned
  by or licensed to ChilliCream Inc. and are protected by applicable copyright
  and trademark law. We grant our users permission to download one copy of the
  materials for personal, non-commercial transitory use.
</p>
<p>
  This constitutes the grant of a license, not a transfer of title. This license
  shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions or the
  Terms of Service, and may be terminated by ChilliCream Inc. at any time.
</p>

<p>
  Our Services and the materials on them are provided on an 'as is' basis. To

  without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability,
  fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual
  property, or other violation of rights.
</p>
<p>
  In no event shall ChilliCream Inc. or its suppliers be liable for any
  consequential loss suffered or incurred by you or any third party arising from
  the use or inability to use the Services or its materials, even if ChilliCream
  Inc. or an authorized representative has been notified, orally or in writing,

  opportunity, loss of savings, loss of reputation, loss of use and/or loss or
  corruption of data, whether under statute, contract, equity, tort (including
  negligence), indemnity, or otherwise.
</p>
<p>
  Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or
  limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these
  limitations may not apply to you.
</p>
<p>
  YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT WE, CHILLICREAM INC., OR OUR DIRECTORS
  OR EMPLOYEES, SHALL, IN NO EVENT, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY UNDER

  DATA, LOSS OF USE, LOST REVENUE OR INCOME OR PROFIT, FAILURE OF SECURITY
  PROTOCOLS OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU ARISING OUT OF
  OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE OR OUR SERVICES OR CONTENT, WHETHER OR
  NOT WE, CHILLICREAM INC., HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF
  THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING. EXCEPT IN CASE OF YOUR VIOLATION
  OF THE 'LIMITATIONS OF USE' SECTION, NEITHER PARTY'S LIABILITY TO THE OTHER
  SHALL EXCEED THE FEES PAID BY YOU TO CHILLICREAM INC. IN THE 3 MONTHS
  IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM. NOTWITHSTANDING
  ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THESE TERMS, CHILLICREAM INC.'S LIABILITY TO YOU
