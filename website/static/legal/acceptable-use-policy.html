<h3>Fair use</h3>
<p>
  We provide our facilities with the assumption your use will be &ldquo;business
  as usual&rdquo;, as per our offer schedule. If your use is considered to be
  excessive, then additional fees may be charged, or capacity may be restricted.
</p>
<p>
  We are opposed to all forms of abuse, discrimination, rights infringement,
  and/or any action that harms or disadvantages any group, individual, or
  resource. We expect our customers and, where applicable, their users
  (&ldquo;end-users&rdquo;) to likewise engage our Services with similar intent.

  reasonable security measures.

  If a customer - or their end-user or anyone using our Services as a result of
  the customer - violates our acceptable use policy, we reserve the right to
  terminate any Services associated with the offending account or the account
  itself or take any remedial or preventative action we deem appropriate,
  without notice. To the extent permitted by law, no credit will be available
  for interruptions of service resulting from any violation of our acceptable
  use policy.
