 *
 * Three modes, chosen from the viewport width and the measured
 * `data-hero-copy` block (`copyRect`, `null` only before it can be found):
 *
 * - `mobile` (w < 768): unchanged from the shipped construction.
 * - `stacked` (768 <= w < 1280): reuses the mobile construction (ring in
 *   the band below the copy, wall behind everything including the copy
 *   band) but the band itself is measured -- `artTop = copyRect.bottom +
 *   24` (fallback `h * 0.77`) -- and the camera's `focal` is solved to fit
 *   the ring to 70-80% of the width, or to the band's own height first
 *   when that's the tighter constraint (`solveFocalForRing`).
 * - `sideBySide` (w >= 1280): the desktop construction, with the art band
 *   computed from the copy instead of the fixed `w/2 + 72`/`0.775w`:
 *   `zoneRight = copyRect.right + 24`, the column centred in
 *   `[zoneRight, w]`, and the whole scene (camera focal, column/wall row
 *   radii) scaled by `s = clamp(bandWidth / 648, 0.85, 1.15)` so the ring
 *   never crosses `zoneRight` and never leaves the frame's right edge.
 *   `648` is the band this construction was tuned and reviewed at (1440,
 *   where `s` lands on exactly `1` and every number below reduces to
 *   today's shipped values -- the pixel-parity gate).
 *
 * The camera sits close to the geometry (`dist` small relative to the
 * wall's own radius) so it reads as being INSIDE the vessel: the wall row
 * at the plasma's height is wide enough that its near face projects past
 * both the left and right frame edges -- the viewer is surrounded, not
 * looking at an object from outside. Column rows share the same axis, at a
 * much smaller, near-constant radius, and their own `ySpread` carries them
 * past the top/bottom frame edges too, so nothing shows the vessel's
 * outside silhouette against bare navy.
