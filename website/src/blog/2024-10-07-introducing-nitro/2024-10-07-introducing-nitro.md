At ChilliCream, we’ve always had a playful and creative approach to naming our products. From **HotChocolate** to **StrawberryShake**, our GraphQL tools have been inspired by delicious drinks that keep things fresh and exciting. Today, we’re taking that tradition to the next level with **Nitro** – the newest addition to our product family that unifies and simplifies how you build, manage, and scale your GraphQL APIs.

# Why Nitro?

As we continue to evolve our offerings, we wanted to create a name that embodies the energy, speed, and efficiency of our tools. Inspired by nitrogen-infused drinks that deliver a smooth yet powerful kick, **Nitro** felt like the perfect fit. Just like those drinks, our Nitro tools are designed to give your GraphQL development process a boost – offering a fast, streamlined, and unified experience.

By renaming **Banana Cake Pop** and **Barista** to **Nitro**, we’re simplifying our ecosystem and making it easier for developers to navigate and interact with our suite of products. Nitro brings everything under one umbrella, making your workflow more cohesive and efficient.

# What’s in the Nitro Ecosystem?

- **Nitro App (Formerly Banana Cake Pop)**

  The Nitro App is your go-to tool for developing, testing, and optimizing GraphQL APIs. Whether you’re inspecting queries, visualizing schemas, or collaborating with your team, Nitro App provides the power and precision needed to supercharge your development workflows.
  Get the Nitro App at [get-nitro.chillicream.com.](https://get-nitro.chillicream.com) or try the Cloud version at [nitro.chillicream.com](https://nitro.chillicream.com).

- **Nitro CLI (Formerly Barista)**

  Nitro CLI offers full control from the command line. It’s perfect for managing APIs, publishing new schema versions, and deploying clients with ease. Whether automating tasks or handling complex GraphQL operations, Nitro CLI simplifies your workflow, allowing you to focus on what matters most – building great APIs.

- **Nitro Server (Formerly Banana Cake Pop Services)**

  Nitro Server is the backbone of the Nitro ecosystem. It provides essential backend services for managing your GraphQL schemas, monitoring API performance, and ensuring smooth operations across your gateways and services. With Nitro Server, you can confidently manage your GraphQL infrastructure, ensuring your clients and APIs remain stable, secure, and scalable as your business grows.

# Local Data Migration for Nitro App

Before upgrading from Banana Cake Pop to the Nitro App, please note that **local data will not be automatically migrated**. To avoid losing any of your documents, make sure to explicitly save them before signing in and syncing your data. Only saved documents will be synced to the cloud, ensuring they are safely stored and accessible when you switch to the Nitro App. Unsaved documents will not be included in the sync.

# New NuGet and NPM Packages

As part of our transition to Nitro, we’ve renamed our NuGet and NPM packages to create a more cohesive experience:

## NuGet Packages

| Old Name                   | New Name              |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Banana Cake Pop.Middleware | ChilliCream.Nitro.App |
| Banana Cake Pop.Services   | ChilliCream.Nitro     |
| Barista                    | ChilliCream.Nitro.CLI |

## NPM Packages

| Old Name                                         | New Name                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| @chillicream/bananacakepop-graphql-ide           | @chillicream/nitro-embedded              |
| @chillicream/bananacakepop-express-middleware    | @chillicream/nitro-express-middleware    |
| @chillicream/bananacakepop-server-adapter-plugin | @chillicream/nitro-server-adapter-plugin |

This unified naming approach isn’t just cosmetic – it simplifies how you interact with our tools, making it easier to find, install, and use everything Nitro has to offer.

# Why This Matters

The Nitro name represents more than just speed and energy. It symbolizes a unified, streamlined ecosystem designed to make your GraphQL development experience seamless. Whether you’re using the desktop app, cloud app, or the CLI tools, Nitro provides all the power and flexibility you need, without the complexity of managing disconnected tools.
