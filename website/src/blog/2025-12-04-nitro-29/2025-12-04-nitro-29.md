Nitro 29 introduces two major advancements that give you greater visibility into how your GraphQL APIs and gateways behave in production.

**The highlights are:**

1. The new Schema Insights view
2. A completely redesigned Operation Plan for Fusion 2

Both features are designed to help teams operate, govern, and evolve their GraphQL systems with clarity and confidence.

## Schema Insights

### Know Exactly How Your Schema Is Used

Every GraphQL team eventually encounters the challenge of determining when it is safe to remove deprecated coordinates. Deprecation is simple. Removal is risky. Without clear usage insights, teams often hesitate to clean up unused fields, arguments, enum values, or even types.

Nitro 29 solves this problem with the new Schema Insight view. It provides real-time analytics at a coordinate level, turning your schema into a measurable and fully observable asset.

**What Schema Insights Provides**

- Last seen and first seen usage for every field, type, argument, and enum value
- Usage trends and request volume over time
- Client breakdown such as Web, Mobile, and Unknown
- Operation-level visibility
- Latency metrics such as mean, p95, and p99
- Throughput and error rates
- Full trace access including the exact GraphQL document sent by the client

This gives teams the confidence to remove deprecated fields exactly when it is safe to do so, based on precise real-world data.

## Full Trace-Level Inspection

Schema Insights allows you to drill down into any coordinate and instantly view the complete execution trace for individual requests.

**You can inspect:**

- The execution timeline
- Resolver performance
- Logs
- The exact GraphQL document with variables

This level of clarity significantly speeds up troubleshooting and performance tuning.

## Schema Tags

### Clear Ownership Information in the Schema

Nitro 29 adds support for schema tags, allowing teams to indicate responsibility for specific parts of the schema.

**Common use cases include:**

- Assigning team ownership
- Marking partner-owned or external fields
- Highlighting experimental or deprecated schema areas
- Improving schema governance in multi-team environments

These tags help ensure that large schemas remain well organized and clearly understood.

## Fusion 2 Enhancements

### A Completely New Operation Plan and Gateway Telemetry

Fusion 2 receives a major upgrade in Nitro 29 with a fully redesigned Operation Plan experience. The new visualization provides complete transparency into how the Fusion gateway executes requests across multiple source schemas.

**New in Fusion 2**

- A brand new operation plan interface
- Telemetry directly enriched into the execution plan
- Schema names shown next to fields so you always know which source schema provided the data

These improvements make it much easier to understand cross-source schema execution paths, identify slow segments, and debug complex routing scenarios in distributed GraphQL architectures.

## Other Improvements and Quality Updates

**Nitro 29 also includes:**

- A refreshed General Settings interface
- Smoother navigation and UX refinements
- Support for default browser login in the Nitro Desktop App. This allows the use of preferred password managers and provides a more modern authentication flow
- Numerous smaller improvements

These updates were made possible by reworking several core internal components.
While this extended the development time for this release, it has significantly increased our ability to deliver new features more quickly going forward.
