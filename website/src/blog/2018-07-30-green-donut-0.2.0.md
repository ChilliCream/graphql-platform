Today we proudly released the first version of _Green Donut_ -- a _DataLoader_ implementation for _.net core_ and _classic_.

**Additional Features**

- _Sliding Expiration_ for caching (default is set to zero which means that the entries in the cache will never expire)
- _Manual Dispatching_ for dispatching programmatically
