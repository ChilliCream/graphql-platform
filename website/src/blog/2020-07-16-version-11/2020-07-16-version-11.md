When I talked to Pascal the other day we reflected on the progress on version 11, where we are now and how we got there. We are now working for almost one year on version 11 and will probably need a couple more months to really polish it and get all the features in. Actually, when talked about this we reflected that the actual version 11 was probably the 10.3 release when all the pure code-first goodness came.

With version 11 we are re-envisioning what we want Hot Chocolate to be. How we want the API to feel and how extensibility works. We have looked at the things that are difficult for users to understand and made these better accessible. We also looked at how we can take things to the next level with a new execution engine that will support execution plans.

Today we are releasing a first developer preview of version 11 with our new configuration API. We call this a developer preview to make it clear that this should not be used in production. This preview is missing a lot of components that are included in version 10.x like filtering, schema stitching and many others. As we go forward we will slowly integrate the missing components and refine the new APIs further.

## Configuration API

OK, after all these disclaimers, let us get into some code and talk features.

The first feature that I want to walk you through is the one that everybody will have to use to setup their GraphQL server and it is also the first breaking feature compared to version 11. When setting up a GraphQL server we most of the time start with an ASP.NET Core web project. Our main configuration part is located in the `Startup.cs`.

With version 10 this setup looked often like the following:

```csharp

public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddGraphQL(sp =>
        SchemaBuilder.New()
            .AddQueryType<Query>());
}
```

This looks nice and simple. Also, the schema builder is a great API that lets us chain in configuration. The main issue that we found with this or where we saw that people had issues was when schema stitching came into play or when you wanted to configure request services or change the execution pipeline and so on. Basically, whenever it got a little more complicated and we had to add more services and integrate other things that where not available on the `SchemaBuilder` it got complicated. The pity here is also that the `SchemaBuilder` is difficult to extend so extensions cannot easily write an extension method that brings in new functionality.

After long nights we came up with a new API that now brings everything to gether and is very easy to extend.

Meet the new configuration API:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services
        .AddGraphQLServer()
            .AddQueryType<Query>();
}
```

Yes, this little example does not look so much different, but it can do a whole lot more.

First, when in a server context like ASP.NET Core or Azure Functions we now have this new `AddGraphQLServer()` method which sets up a new schema and executor with additional services that the server needs. This API also does not allow just one schema but multiple.

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services
        .AddGraphQLServer()
            .AddQueryType<Query>()
        .AddGraphQLServer("internal")
            .AddQueryType<Query>()
            .AddTypeExtension<InternalQueryExtension>();
}
```

The above code sets up two schemas. One is our default schema and adds a `Query` type. The other schema is called `internal` adds the same `Query` but also extends this query with some internal queries.

I can put each of these schemas on a different route and for that we also now support Microsoft`s new routing API.

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    app.UseRouting();

    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapGraphQL();
        endpoints.MapGraphQL("/internal", schemaName: "internal");
    });
```

This makes it very easy to map various schemas to various routes and secure and limit those routes.

But there is even more to that. Since we also have some new schema stitching features in mind around this the new configuration API allows to hot reload schema configurations on the fly. Meaning you can push schema configurations to a running server. While there is now magical port to push schema configurations too the new configuration API allows you to create configurations that pull can be pulled in asynchronously whenever an executer is evicted. We will have more on this with the next few previews.

Another, part that I mentioned is now that we can more seamlessly configure a schema. If we wanted for instance to add apollo tracing support to one schema but not the other we can do that with one line of code:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services
        .AddGraphQLServer()
            .AddQueryType<Query>()
        .AddGraphQLServer("internal")
            .AddQueryType<Query>()
            .AddTypeExtension<InternalQueryExtension>()
            .AddApolloTracing();
}
```

This means that only the executor for the internal schema will have any performance impact while executing. It really was just one line of code that we have added to our schema configuration.

## Subscriptions

Another area that is now super simple to setup are subscriptions. In order to use in-memory subscriptions we configure our schema like the following:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services
        .AddGraphQLServer()
            .AddQueryType<Query>()
            .AddSubscriptionType<Mutation>()
            .AddSubscriptionType<Subscription>()
            .AddInMemorySubscriptions();
}
```

Again, I can have in-memory subscriptions on one schema and Redis subscriptions on the other.

Next we need to define our `Mutation` type in order to trigger subscriptions whenever something happens on our server.

```csharp
public class Mutation
{
    public string SendMessage(
        string userId
        string message,
        [Service] ITopicEventSender eventSender)
    {
        eventSender.SendAsync(userId, message);
        return message;
    }
}
```

In our example we have a mutation that can send a text message to a user represented by the user API. In order to send a message to our subscription bus we are using the userId argument as a topic and the message as a payload and use the injected `ITopicEventSender` to send the message.

In our subscription type we do not need to handle the receive process or anything. We just specify what the topic is and what the message is and everything will be automatically injected.

```csharp
public class Subscription
{
    [Subscribe]
    public string OnMessage(
        [Topic] string userId,
        [EventMessage] string message) =>
        message;
}
```

The userId in this instance is an argument that is provided from the outside, whereas the message is a parameter where the subscription bus injects the sent message into our resolver.

```graphql
subscription onMessage {
  onMessage(userId: "123");
}
```

There are a lot more variants with the new subscriptions but I will cover that in a later blog post that only looks at subscriptions and what we can do with them.

## Extensibility

We put a big emphasis
