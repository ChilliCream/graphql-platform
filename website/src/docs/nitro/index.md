# Features

1. **GraphQL IDE**
   Whether you're building or consuming GraphQL APIs, Nitro simplifies the process by allowing you to effortlessly build and execute GraphQL queries and mutations. Its intuitive UI enables you to visualize and explore your GraphQL schemas, making it easier to understand and work with complex structures. The powerful editor provides syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and error highlighting, helping you write GraphQL queries and mutations with ease.

2. **Collaboration**
   Additionally, Nitro places a strong emphasis on collaboration. It offers seamless team collaboration features, allowing developers to share documents, API configurations, environment settings and lets you collaborate on projects, and synchronize your work across multiple team members. By facilitating effective communication, Nitro ensures that everyone on your team is on the same page, leading to more efficient and coordinated development efforts.

3. **DevOps**
   Nitro supports you during the entire lifecycle of an API. With its schema and client registry, Nitro ensures that your APIs are well-maintained and evolve seamlessly over time. Integrated into your development workflow, Nitro helps you manage your APIs effectively, making easy to build and maintain high-quality APIs.

4. **Schema Registry**
   Nitro's schema registry acts as a centralized repository for your GraphQL schemas. It allows you to store, version, and manage your schemas effectively. Whenever you make changes to your schema, Nitro tracks and documents those changes, making it easy to keep a history of modifications. This ensures that you have full visibility into the evolution of your API, making it easier to understand and troubleshoot issues that may arise during development.

5. **Client Registry**
   The client registry feature of Nitro complements the schema registry by providing a centralized location to manage and track the clients that consume your GraphQL APIs. It enables you to register and document all the client applications that interact with your APIs. By maintaining an up-to-date client registry, you can easily identify which clients may be affected by schema changes and take appropriate actions to ensure a smooth transition.

6. **Intuitive Interface**
   Nitro provides a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate, even for those new to GraphQL. Its clean and intuitive design makes it a pleasure to work with, enabling developers to focus on their tasks without unnecessary distractions or complications.
