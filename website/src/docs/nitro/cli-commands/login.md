title: Login

The `nitro login` command is used to log into your user account on Nitro CLI. On execution, Nitro CLI attempts to launch a web browser to facilitate an interactive login process. This allows you to authenticate with your credentials and provides a seamless link between the command-line interface and the web-based management console.

To use the `nitro login` command, type it into your terminal as shown below:

```shell
nitro login
```

This command does not require any specific arguments or options for basic execution. After running the command, follow the prompts in the newly launched web browser to complete the login process.
