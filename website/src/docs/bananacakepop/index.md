Banana Cake Pop makes it easy and enjoyable to test your GraphQL server implementations. It works well with Hot Chocolate and any other GraphQL server. Try it out and give us feedback via [slack](http://slack.chillicream.com/) in the **#banana-cake-pop** channel.

# Web
You can try Banana Cake Pop on the web by going to [eat.bananacakepop.com](https://eat.bananacakepop.com/)

The web version will let you query public GraphQL APIs and try out the Banana Cake Pop features. However, if you want to access local GraphQL servers, we recommend installing the Banana Cake Pop App.

# Desktop App

> The Banana Cake Pop App is currently in preview and the current version is `1.0.0-preview.31`. It has an auto-update feature built in, so as new releases come out you will be notified to update within the app.
