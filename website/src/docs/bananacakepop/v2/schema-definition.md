The "Schema Definition" part of Banana Cake Pop allows you to see the raw Schema Definition Language (SDL) of your GraphQL server.

To access the definition click the dropdown where it says "Operations" and select "Schema Definition".

This will change the workspace area from "Operations" and "Response" to "Schema Definition".

You can either explore the SDL in the editor or download it by click the download icon in the top right hand corner of the "Schema Definition" area.
