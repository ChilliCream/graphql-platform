An API within the context of Banana Cake Pop, refers to an representation of your GraphQL Servers. 
This representation is more than a mere conceptual framework â€” it serves as a practical tool that allows you to group your documents and share common settings like connection and authorization parameters among them.

Additionally, an API forms the foundation for your client registry, schema registry setup and the telemetry. For more detailed information on these features, refer to the [Schema Registry](/docs/bananacakepop/v2/apis/schema-registry) guide
 the [Client Registry](/docs/bananacakepop/v2/apis/client-registry) and the [Telemetry](/docs/bananacakepop/v2/apis/open-telemetry) guide.

Creating an API in Banana Cake Pop is a user-friendly process. There are three methods available:

1. Click on the `Create Api` button located at the top of the document explorer toolbar.
2. Right-click within the document explorer and select `New Api` from the context menu. This creates a new API within the currently selected folder. Note: APIs can be organized in folders but cannot be nested within each other.
3. Choose the API Type. Options include `API Collection`, `API Service`, or `API Gateway`.
