# Introduction

> We are still working on the documentation for Strawberry Shake so help us by finding typos, missing things or write some additional docs with us.

Strawberry Shake is an open-source GraphQL client that is compliant with the newest GraphQL draft spec, which makes Strawberry Shake compatible to all GraphQL compliant servers like Hot Chocolate, Apollo Server, GraphQL Java and various other servers out there.

Strawberry Shake removes the complexity of state management and lets you interact with local and remote data through GraphQL.

You can use Strawberry Shake to:

- Generate a C# client from your GraphQL queries.
- Interact with local and remote data through GraphQL.
- Use reactive APIs to interact with your state.
