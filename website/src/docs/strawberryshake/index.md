# Introduction
Strawberry Shake is an open-source GraphQL client. It is suitable for both, backend to backend or frontend to backend communication.
It offers all one would expect from a modern GraphQL client:
 - Code generation based on your defined operations
 - A reactive store that automatically caches data for you
 - Support for multiple clients per project

Strawberry Shake is very easy to set up and takes the clutter away from consuming GraphQL APIs with C#. We update Strawberry Shake continuously and will implement new spec features as soon as they hit draft status. This lets you pick up new GraphQL features incrementally to open up new development opportunities for your ideas.

Let's get started with Strawberry Shake!
