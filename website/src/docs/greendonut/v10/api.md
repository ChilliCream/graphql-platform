# Methods

---

## Clear()

**Description:** Empties the complete cache.

**Return Value:** `void`

---

## DispatchAsync()

**Description:** Dispatches one or more batch requests. In case of auto
dispatching we just trigger an implicit dispatch which could mean to interrupt a
wait delay. Whereas in a manual dispatch scenario it could mean to dispatch
explicitly.

**Return Value:** `Task`

## LoadAsync(TKey key)

**Description:** Loads a single value by key. This call may return a cached
value or enqueues this single request for batching if enabled.

**Return Value:** `Task<TValue>`

---

## LoadAsync(params TKey[] keys)

**Description:** Loads multiple values by keys. This call may return cached
values and enqueues requests which were not cached for batching if enabled.

**Return Value:** `Task<IReadOnlyList<TValue>>`

---

## LoadAsync(IReadOnlyCollection<TKey\> keys)

**Description:** Loads multiple values by keys. This call may return cached
values and enqueues requests which were not cached for batching if enabled.

**Return Value:** `Task<IReadOnlyList<TValue>>`

---

## Remove(TKey key)

**Description:** Removes a single entry from the cache.

**Return Value:** `void`

---

## Set(TKey key, TValue value)

**Description:** Adds a new entry to the cache if not already exists.

**Return Value:** `void`

---

## Set(TKey key, Task<TValue\> value)
