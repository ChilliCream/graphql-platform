_Hot Chocolate_ is an open-source _GraphQL_ server that is compliant with the newest _GraphQL_ 2020 spec. This makes Hot Chocolate compatible to all _GraphQL_ compliant clients like _Strawberry Shake_, _Relay_ or _Apollo Client_ and to a variety of tools.

_Hot Chocolate_ takes the complexity away from building a fully fledged GraphQL server and lets you focus on delivering the next big thing.

You can use _Hot Chocolate Server_ as:

- A stand-alone ASP.NET Core GraphQL Server.
- A serverless Azure Function or Amazon Lambda that serves up a spec compliant GraphQL server.
- A Gateway for a federated data graph both for our own _Hot Chocolate Stitching_ or for _Apollo Federation_.

_Hot Chocolate_ is easy to setup and takes the clutter away.

We update _Hot Chocolate_ continuously and implement new spec features as they hit draft status. This lets you pick up new GraphQL features incrementally.
