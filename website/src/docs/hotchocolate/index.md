Hot Chocolate is an open-source GraphQL server that is compliant with the newest GraphQL 2020 spec. This makes Hot Chocolate compatible to all GraphQL compliant clients like Strawberry Shake, Relay or Apollo Client and to a variety of tools.

Hot Chocolate takes the complexity away from building a fully fledged GraphQL server and lets you focus on delivering the next big thing.

You can use Hot Chocolate Server as:

- A stand-alone ASP.NET Core GraphQL Server.
- A serverless Azure Function or Amazon Lambda that serves up a spec compliant GraphQL server.
- A Gateway for a federated data graph both for our own Hot Chocolate Stitching or for Apollo Federation.

Hot Chocolate is easy to setup and takes the clutter away.

We update Hot Chocolate continuously and implement new spec features as they hit draft status. This lets you pick up new GraphQL features incrementally.
