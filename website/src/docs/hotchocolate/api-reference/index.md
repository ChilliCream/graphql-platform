> We are still working on the documentation for Hot Chocolate 11.1 so help us by finding typos, missing things or write some additional docs with us.

The API Reference provides deep dives into specific subjects like [ASP.NET Core](/docs/hotchocolate/api-reference/aspnetcore) configuration or how you can use [object type extensions](/docs/hotchocolate/api-reference/object-type).
