title: Filtering - Filter & Operation Kinds
---

Filtering can be broken down into different kinds of filters that then have different operations.
The filter kind is bound to the type. A string is fundamentally something different than an array or an object.
Each filter kind has different operations that can be applied to it. Some operations are unique to a filter and some operations are shared across multiple filters.
e.g. A string filter has string specific operations like `Contains` or `EndsWith` but still shares the operations `Equals` and `NotEquals` with the boolean filter.

### Filter Kinds

Hot Chocolate knows following filter kinds
