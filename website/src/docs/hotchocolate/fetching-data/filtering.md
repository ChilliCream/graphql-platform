# Use Diagrams

Use [mermaid diagrams](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid) to help a reader understand complex problems. Jump over to the [mermaid playground](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor) to test your diagrams.

```mermaid

  A[Christmas] -->|Get money| B(Go shopping)
  B --> C{Let me think}
  C -->|One| D[Laptop]
  C -->|Two| E[iPhone]
  C -->|Three| F[fa:fa-car Car]
```

# Use Code Examples

A code example is another tool to help readers following the document and understanding the problem. Here is an list of code blocks that are used often with the ChilliCream GraphQL platform.

Use `sdl` to describe GraphQL schemas.

```sdl
type Author {
  name: String!
}
```

Use `graphql` to describe GraphQL operations.

```graphql
query {
  author(id: 1) {
    name
  }
}
```

Use `json` for everything JSON related for example a GraphQL result.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "author": {
      "name": "ChilliCream"
    }
  }
}
```

Use `sql` for SQL queries.

```sql
SELECT id FROM Authors WHERE id = 1
```

Use `csharp` for C# code.

```csharp
public interface Author
{
    int Id { get; }

    string Name { get; }
}
```
