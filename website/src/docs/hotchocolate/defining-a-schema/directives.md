Hi,

We're currently working on the version 11 documentation. Probably right now at this very moment. However, this is an open-source project, and we need any help we can get! You can jump in at any time and help us improve the documentation for hundreds or even thousands of developers!

In case you might need help, check out our [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/hotchocolategraphql/shared_invite/enQtNTA4NjA0ODYwOTQ0LTViMzA2MTM4OWYwYjIxYzViYmM0YmZhYjdiNzBjOTg2ZmU1YmMwNDZiYjUyZWZlMzNiMTk1OWUxNWZhMzQwY2Q) and get immediate help from the core contributors or the community itself.

Sorry for any inconvenience, and thank you for being patient!

The ChilliCream Team
