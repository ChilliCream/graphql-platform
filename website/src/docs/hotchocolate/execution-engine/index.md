# Request Middleware

The GraphQL execution is abstracted into a request pipeline composed of many request middleware. Each request middleware represents one part of executing a GraphQL request, like the parsing of the GraphQL request document or the semantical validation of the GraphQL request document.

# Field middleware

Field middleware allows us to create reusable logic that is run before or after a resolver. It also allows us to access or even modify the result produced by a resolver.
