title: "Visitors"

Hot Chocolate creates an abstract syntax tree for every incoming request. The execution engine evaluates this syntax tree in many different ways. Validation is a good example. Every incoming request has to be validated. The execution engine has to be sure that the semantic of the requested document is correct. A set of rules is applied to the syntax tree, to find potential semantic flaws.

Usually, you do not have to access the _AST_ directly. The AST only becomes significant, when you want to change execution behavior based on the structure of the query. For example features like _Filtering_, _Sorting_, or _Selection_, analyze the incoming query and generate expressions based on it.

Hot Chocolate provides you with different APIs that support you to traverse these trees. The `SyntaxWalker` is a visitor that has built-in all the logic to _walk down a syntax tree_.

The `SyntaxWalker` is completely stateless. All the state is on a context object that is passed along. The generic argument `TContext` of `SyntaxWalker<TContext>` denotes the type of the context.

To start the visitation of a _GraphQL_ syntax tree, you have to pass the node and the context the visitation should start from to the visitors `Visit` method.

# Visitation

To start the visitation of a _GraphQL_ syntax tree, you have to pass the node and the context the visitation should start from to the visitors `Visit` method. On its way down the syntax tree, the visitor _enters_ a node. The visitor then gets the children of the current node and _enters_ its children. Once the visitor reached a leaf node, it starts walking back up the tree and _leaves_ all the nodes. The visitor provides a virtual `Enter` and a virtual `Leave` method for all _GraphQL_ AST nodes. These methods are called from the visitor as it _enters_ or _leaves_ a node.

The syntax walker provides a few methods in addition to the `Enter` and `Leave` methods. For these two methods, there are also convenience methods that are called right _before_ and _after_ the method call. Namely, `OnBeforeEnter`, `OnAfterEnter`, `OnBeforeLeave`, `OnAfterLeave`.
These methods can modify the current `TContext`. These _before_ and _after_ methods are good places to initialize state that is used in the main _enter_ or _leave_ method. e.g. before entering a `FieldNode`, you may want to peek the latest type from the context and get the instance of the `ObjectField` corresponding to `FieldNode` of this type. You may also want to push this type onto the context to then use it in the `Enter` method.

# Visitor Actions

The _Enter_ and _Leave_ methods return visitor actions. These methods control the visitors' next step in the visitation. Visitor actions can be used to _skip_ further visitation and step back up, or to _continue_ and walk the current branch of the tree further down.

## Continue

If `Continue` is returned from the `Enter` or `Leave` method visitation on the current branch continues.

In the following example `Continue` is returned from the onEnter method. The visitor calls `VisitChildren` and continues by _entering_ the selection set.

```graphql {4}
query {
  foo {
    bar
    baz @onEnter(return: SKIP) {
      quux
    }
    qux
  }
}
```

## Skip

If `Skip` is returned from the `Enter` or `Leave` method, further visitation on this node stops.

In the following example `Skip` is returned from the onEnter method. The visitor skips the field _baz_. It continues visitation by _entering_ the field _qux_.

```graphql {4}
query {
  foo {
    bar
    baz @onEnter(return: SKIP) {
      quux
    }
    qux
  }
}
```

## SkipAndLeave

If `SkipAndLeave` is returned from the `Enter` method, further visitation on this node stops. Instead of directly calling the next `Enter` method. The visitor calls the `Leave` method of the current node first.

In the following example `SkipAndLeave` is returned from the onEnter method. The visitor skips the field _baz_. Before it continues visitation with the field _qux_ it _leaves_ the field _baz_ by calling `Leave`

```graphql {4}
query {
  foo {
    bar
    baz @onEnter(return: SKIPANDLEAVE) {
      quux
    }
    qux
  }
}
```

## Break

If `Break` is returned from the `Enter` or `Leave` method, further visitation on this branch stops.

In the following example `Break` is returned from the onEnter method. The visitor immediately starts walking back up. The visitor calls the `Leave` on `foo` instead of visiting the selections set of _baz_ it skips _baz_ and _qux_.

```graphql {4}
query {
  foo {
    bar
    baz @onEnter(return: BREAK) {
      quux
    }
    qux
  }
}
```
