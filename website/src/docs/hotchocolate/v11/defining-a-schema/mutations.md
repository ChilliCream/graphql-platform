The mutation type in GraphQL is used to mutate/change data. This means that when we are doing mutations, we are intending to cause side-effects in the system.

GraphQL defines mutations as top-level fields on the mutation type. Meaning only the fields on the mutation root type itself are mutations. Everything that is returned from a mutation field represents the changed state of the server.

```sdl
type Mutation {
  addBook(input: AddBookInput!): AddBookPayload!
  publishBook(input: PublishBookInput!): PublishBookPayload!
}
```

Clients can execute one or more mutations through the mutation type.

```graphql
mutation {
  addBook(input: { title: "C# in depth" }) {
    book {
      id
      title
    }
  }
  publishBook(input: { id: 1 }) {
    book {
      publishDate
    }
  }
}
```

Each of these mutations is executed serially one by one whereas their child selection sets are executed possibly in parallel since only top-level mutation fields (those directly under `mutation`) are allowed to cause side-effects in GraphQL.

# Usage

A mutation type can be defined like the following.

<ExampleTabs.Annotation>

```csharp
public class Mutation
{
    public async Task<BookAddedPayload> AddBook(Book book)
    {
        // Omitted code for brevity
    }
}

public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services
            .AddGraphQLServer()
            .AddMutationType<Mutation>();
    }

    // Omitted code for brevity
}
```

</ExampleTabs.Annotation>
<ExampleTabs.Code>

```csharp
public class Mutation
{
    public async Task<BookAddedPayload> AddBook(Book book)
    {
        // Omitted code for brevity
    }
}

public class MutationType : ObjectType<Mutation>
{
    protected override void Configure(
        IObjectTypeDescriptor<Mutation> descriptor)
    {
        descriptor.Field(f => f.AddBook(default));
    }
}

public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services
            .AddGraphQLServer()
            .AddMutationType<MutationType>();
    }
}
```

</ExampleTabs.Code>
<ExampleTabs.Schema>

```csharp
public class Mutation
{
    public async Task<BookAddedPayload> AddBook(Book book)
    {
        // Omitted code for brevity
    }
}

public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services
            .AddGraphQLServer()
            .AddDocumentFromString(@"
                type Mutation {
                  addBook(input: BookInput): Book
                }

                input BookInput {
                  title: String
                  author: String
                }

                type Book {
                  title: String
                  author: String
                }
            ")
            .BindComplexType<Mutation>();
    }
}
```

# Transactions

With multiple mutations executed serially in one request it can be useful to wrap these in a transaction that we can control.

Hot Chocolate provides for this the `ITransactionScopeHandler` which is used by the operation execution middleware to create transaction scopes for mutation requests.

Hot Chocolate provides a default implementation based on the `System.Transactions.TransactionScope` which works with Microsoft ADO.NET data provider and hence can be used in combination with Entity Framework.

The default transaction scope handler can be added like the following.

```csharp
services
    .AddGraphQLServer()
    .AddDefaultTransactionScopeHandler();
```

This is how the default implementation looks like:

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Represents the default mutation transaction scope handler implementation.
/// </summary>
public class DefaultTransactionScopeHandler : ITransactionScopeHandler
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Creates a new transaction scope for the current
    /// request represented by the <see cref="IRequestContext"/>.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="context">
    /// The GraphQL request context.
    /// </param>
    /// <returns>
    /// Returns a new <see cref="ITransactionScope"/>.
    /// </returns>
    public virtual ITransactionScope Create(IRequestContext context)
    {
        return new DefaultTransactionScope(
            context,
            new TransactionScope(
                TransactionScopeOption.Required,
                new TransactionOptions
                {
                    IsolationLevel = IsolationLevel.ReadCommitted
                }));
    }
}
```

If we implement a custom transaction scope handler or if we choose to extend upon the default transaction scope handler, we can add it like the following.

```csharp
services
    .AddGraphQLServer()
    .AddTransactionScopeHandler<CustomTransactionScopeHandler>();
```
