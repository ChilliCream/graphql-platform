This acceptable use policy covers the products, services, and technologies (collectively referred to as the &ldquo;Services&rdquo; provided by ChilliCream Inc. under any ongoing agreement.

ChilliCream Inc. customers found engaging in activities prohibited by this acceptable use policy can be liable for service suspension and account termination. In extreme cases, we may be legally obliged to report such customers to the relevant authorities.

# Fair use

We provide our facilities with the assumption your use will be &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo;, as per our offer schedule. If your use is considered to be excessive, then additional fees may be charged, or capacity may be restricted.

We are opposed to all forms of abuse, discrimination, rights infringement, and/or any action that harms or disadvantages any group, individual, or resource. We expect our customers and, where applicable, their users (&ldquo;end-users&rdquo;) to likewise engage our Services with similar intent.

We regard our customers as being responsible for their own actions as well as for the actions of anyone using our Services with the customer's permission. This responsibility also applies to anyone using our Services on an unauthorized basis as a result of the customer's failure to put in place reasonable security measures.

By accepting Services from us, our customers agree to ensure adherence to this policy on behalf of anyone using the Services as their end users. Complaints regarding the actions of customers or their end-users will be forwarded to the nominated contact for the account in question.

If a customer - or their end-user or anyone using our Services as a result of the customer - violates our acceptable use policy, we reserve the right to terminate any Services associated with the offending account or the account itself or take any remedial or preventative action we deem appropriate, without notice. To the extent permitted by law, no credit will be available for interruptions of service resulting from any violation of our acceptable use policy.
