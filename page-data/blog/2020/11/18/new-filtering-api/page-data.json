During schema initialization, we annotate the matching handler directly from the convention onto the field. For this, we use a new concept call type interceptors. This comes with a few benefits. Firstly, we know during schema creation if all required handlers are registered. In case we do not find a matching handler, we can now fail early and tell the developer what is missing. Secondly, we do not have to do runtime lookups. All handlers are now directly stored on the fields and are available on visitation.
