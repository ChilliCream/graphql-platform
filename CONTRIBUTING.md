# How to contribute

One of the easiest ways to contribute is to participate in discussions on GitHub issues. You can also contribute by submitting pull requests with code changes.

## General feedback and discussions?

Start a discussion on the [repository issue tracker](https://github.com/ChilliCream/hotchocolate/issues) or [join us on slack](https://bit.ly/joinchilli).

## Bugs and feature requests?

Before reporting a new issue, try to find an existing issue if one already exists. If it already exists, upvote (👍) it. Also consider adding a comment with your unique scenarios and requirements related to that issue.

If you can't find one, you can file a new issue by choosing the appropriate template [here](https://github.com/ChilliCream/hotchocolate/issues/new/choose).

## How to submit a pull request

We are always happy to see pull requests from community members both for bug fixes as well as new features.

### Finding an issue to work on

We have marked issues which are good candidates for first-time contributors, in case you are not already set on working on a specific issue.

- ["Good first issue" issues](https://github.com/ChilliCream/hotchocolate/labels/%F0%9F%99%8B%20good%20first%20issue) - we think these are a great for newcomers.
- ["Help wanted" issues](https://github.com/ChilliCream/hotchocolate/labels/%F0%9F%99%8B%20help%20wanted) - these issues are up for grabs.

### Before writing code

Before you spend time writing code, make sure of the following things:

- You have commented on the related issue to let others know you are working on it
- You have laid out your solution on a high level and received approval from the maintainers, if you are tackling a bigger change

TODO: https://docs.github.com/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo

### Before submitting a pull request

Before submitting a pull request, make sure that it checks the following requirements:

- You add test coverage following existing patterns within the codebase
- Your code matches the existing syntax conventions within the codebase
- Your pull request is small, focused, and avoids making unrelated changes

If your pull request contains any of the below, it's less likely to be merged.

- Changes that break backward compatibility
- Changes that are only wanted by one person/company
- Changes that add entirely new feature areas without prior agreement
- Changes that are mostly about refactoring existing code or code style

### Submitting a pull request

Core contributors will review your pull request and provide feedback.
