## [0.6.0] - 2018-11-12

### Added

- Separate package providing a _GraphiQL_ middleware. The middleware can serve all of _GraphiQL_ without needing to refer to CDNs making it useful even in closed networks. Moreover, we have configured _GraphiQL_ to work with the _GraphQL-ws_ protocol which is supported by _Hot Chocolate_.
- Initial Support for _GraphQL_ subscriptions. We currently support the _GraphQL-ws_ protocol over web sockets. There will be a lot of additional work in version _0.7.0_ that will harden it.
- Authorization package for ASP.net core which supports policy-base authorization on fields.
- Diagnostic source which can be used to track field execution times and other events.
- Implementing a directive middleware has now become much easier with this release. We have built the authorize-directive with these new APIs.
