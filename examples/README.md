# Examples

We recommend starting with our GraphQL workshop that guides you through various concepts of building a GraphQL server.

The GraphQL workshop is located here:

We have even more examples touching various topics in our examples repository, which you can find here:

Just let us remind you that we have a great community that congregates on our slack channel. We can only recommend signing up and take part in our journey of building this platform.
