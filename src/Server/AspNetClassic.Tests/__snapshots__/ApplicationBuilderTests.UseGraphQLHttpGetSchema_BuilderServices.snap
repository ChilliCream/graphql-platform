"The `Boolean` scalar type represents `true` or `false`."
scalar Boolean

"The `Float` scalar type represents signed double-precision fractional values as specified by [IEEE 754](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/IEEE_floating_point)."
scalar Float

"The `ID` scalar type represents a unique identifier, often used to refetch an object or as key for a cache. The ID type appears in a JSON response as a String; however, it is not intended to be human-readable. When expected as an input type, any string (such as `\"4\"`) or integer (such as `4`) input value will be accepted as an ID."
scalar ID

"The `Int` scalar type represents non-fractional signed whole numeric values. Int can represent values between -(2^31) and 2^31 - 1."
scalar Int

scalar PaginationAmount

"The `String` scalar type represents textual data, represented as UTF-8 character sequences. The String type is most often used by GraphQL to represent free-form human-readable text."
scalar String
