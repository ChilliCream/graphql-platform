            "description": "Information is everywhere and for many people, especially in the connected world, it is accessible freely or at a minimal cost. News outlets rely on social media to broadcast breaking news. Social media in turn relies on us to feed it with information, be it of our surroundings or our personal information. It’s become somewhat of a self-sustaining self-serving machine in which we’re all part of. It’s big data and we’re a cog in the wheel. For now of course, because with big data and cheap yet powerful hardware, AI also wants to play the game.\r\n\r\nAnd if information and knowledge is the key to success, surely this means we’re on the right path. The question is, will we notice some of the warning signs before it’s too late…",

            "description": "A deep dive into some of the technical challenges and solutions to securing a microservice architecture.\r\n\r\nMicroservices are great, and they offer us lots of options for how we can build, scale and evolve our applications. On the face of it, they should also help us create much more secure applications - the ability to protect in depth is a key part of protecting systems, and microservices make this much easier. On the other hand, information that used to flow within single processes, now flows over our networks, giving us a real headache. How do we make sure our shiny new microservices architectures aren’t less secure than their monolithic predecessor.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I outline some of the key challenges associated with microservice architectures with respect to security, and then looks at approaches to address these issues. From secret stores, time-limited credentials and better backups, to confused deputy problems, JWT tokens and service meshes, this talk looks at the state of the art for building secure microservice architectures.",

While the paper and subsequent talks provided great insight in the challenges of coordinating activities across entities in a single database, implementations were left as an exercise to the reader!\r\n\r\nFast forward to today, and now we have NoSQL databases, microservices, message queues and brokers, HTTP web services and more that don't (and shouldn't) support any kind of distributed transaction.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we'll look at how to implement coordination between non-transactional resources using Pat's paper as a guide, with examples in Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Service Bus, and Azure SQL Server. We'll look at a real-world example where a codebase assumed everything would be transactional and always succeed, but production proved us wrong! Finally, we'll look at advanced coordination workflows such as Sagas to achieve robust, scalable coordination across the enterprise.",

From the F# perspective, this fits with the default non-nullness of other F# types. But compatibility with existing code makes designing this a wild ride indeed! In this talk, we'll briefly explain what nullability means for F#, some existing mitigations for null in the language, and how we must consider compatibility with everything in mind. This deep dive into language design should give you an idea about what it is like designing a nontrivial feature that improves existing code while remaining compatible with it.",

We'll start by describing the problems faced by a SaaS platform like ours, then run through some specific instrumentation practices that we love and have used successfully to gain the visibility we need into our system’s day-to-day operations.",

Few people like \"programming\" YAML or JSON (even the human-friendly variants!), and even fewer like having to reverse-engineer ways to apply known good development practices to tools which resist it at all cost.\r\n\r\nSo, what if things were different,and programming infrastructure was more like real programming, with real programming languages like TypeScript? What if you defined Lambda functions by actually writing lambdas, created abstractions using complex types, and could take advantage of existing tools for modularity, linting, refactoring and testing?\r\n\r\nEnter Pulumi, an open-source deployment engine which enables all these things using TypeScript, Python or Go!\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll look at how you can write TypeScript code using Pulumi to provision traditional cloud infrastructure, manage Kubernetes and build portable \"serverless\" applications - all with minimal YAML in sight! We'll look at deploying to multiple regions of the same cloud, and how to build abstractions allowing multi-cloud to be a reality.",

While technology impacts our everyday life in almost every way, the solutions we create fails to reflect our society or the world we live in. Instead, they often reinforce stereotypes, prejudice, and differences. In this talk, we will look into the lack of diversity and how diversity will make us more suited to solve problems and meet the needs of our society. We will address the culture in our communities, the reasons why minorities quit, and the importance of diversity in tech.",

Modern methods and techniques take a very different approach based on resiliency, which promotes embracing failure instead of trying to avoid it. Resilient architectures enhance observability, leverage well-known patterns such as graceful degradation, timeouts and circuit breakers and embrace chaos engineering, a discipline that promotes breaking things on purpose in order to learn how to build more resilient systems. In this session, will review the most useful patterns for building resilient software systems and I will introduce chaos engineering methodology and especially show the audience how they can benefit from breaking things on purpose.",

Now though, we can just use C# in a way that's both more approachable for more developers and lends itself to more ambitious levels of dynamic behavior. In this talk I'll show some of the ways I've been using this technique to create more efficient, low allocation application frameworks. We'll also dive into the Utf8Json library already uses this approach today in its support for very highly efficient Json parsing.",

            "description": "We’ve all heard a lot in the last year about a new advancement in the world of CSS, called CSS Grid. Starting off at whispers, we’re now starting to hear it as a deafening roar as more and more developers write about it, talk about it, share it and start using it. In the world of front end, I see it everywhere I turn and am excited as I start to use it in my own projects.\r\n\r\nBut what does this new CSS specification mean for software developers, and why should you care about it? In the world of tech today, we can do so many amazing things and use whatever language we choose across a wide range of devices and platforms. Whether it’s the advent of React and React Native, or frameworks like Electron, it’s easier than ever to build one app that works on multiple platforms with the language we know and work with best. The ability to do this also expands to styling apps on any platform using CSS, and therefore being able to utilise the magical thing that is\r\nCSS Grid.\r\n\r\nThe reason CSS Grid is gaining so much attention, is because it’s a game changer for front end and layouts. With a few simple lines of code, we can now create imaginative, dynamic, responsive layouts (yep, I know that’s a lot of buzz words). While a lot of people are calling this the new ‘table layout’, grid gives us so much more, with the ability to spread cells across columns and rows to whatever size you choose, dictate which direction new items flow, allow cells to move around to fit in place and even tell certain cells exactly where they need to sit.\r\n\r\nWhile there is so much to worry about when developing an app, CSS Grid means that you can worry less about building the layout on the front end, and more about making sure the back end works well. Let me show you how the magic works.",

This lively dog-based* talk is about the rewards and pitfalls involved in introducing pair programming, TDD and an agile development approach to experienced developers who are used to working in a different way. It includes several practical suggestions of how to help and convince less agile-experienced colleagues.\r\nBased on my experience as a consultant technical lead, the aim is to help you to move your team members to a state of childlike fearlessness where learning is fun; is embedded in everything you do; and applies to all team members regardless of experience. \r\n*It turns out that images of dogs can be used to illustrate an astonishing variety of concepts!",

Having the wrong software and support structures was a key factor in the failures of our first park. We were entrepreneurs launching something new and architects integrating an enterprise. And our decisions had lasting consequences. Deciding which problems were worth our time was foundational to our failure.\r\n\r\nJoin us for a retrospective of software systems at Jurassic Park. We’ll dig into case studies and explore our successes and failures. We’ll uncover the options, costs, and risks inherent in deciding what software to build, what to buy, and alternatives in between. We’ll explore the opportunity cost of building systems, the sustainability of open-source, and the risks of vendor lock-in. You’ll leave equipped to make better decisions and avoid the pitfalls we made at Jurassic Park.",

It’s become somewhat of a self-sustaining self-serving machine in which we’re all part of. It’s big data and we’re a cog in the wheel. For now of course, because with big data and cheap yet powerful hardware, AI also wants to play the game.\r\n\r\nAnd if information and knowledge is the key to success, surely this means we’re on the right path. The question is, will we notice some of the warning signs before it’s too late…",

But instead of trying to predict the various ways something might go sideways right before release and crafting dashboards to prepare, what might it look like to use answers about our system to figure out what to build, and how to build it, and whom for?\r\n\r\nObservability is the practice of understanding the internal state of a system via knowledge of its external outputs -- and is something that should be built into the process of crafting software from the very beginning.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll discuss what this might look like in practice by using Honeycomb as a case study: how we rely on visibility into our system to inform planning during the development process, to observe the impact of new changes during and after release, and, of course, debug. We'll start by describing the problems faced by a SaaS platform like ours, then run through some specific instrumentation practices that we love and have used successfully to gain the visibility we need into our system’s day-to-day operations.",

On the face of it, they should also help us create much more secure applications - the ability to protect in depth is a key part of protecting systems, and microservices make this much easier. On the other hand, information that used to flow within single processes, now flows over our networks, giving us a real headache. How do we make sure our shiny new microservices architectures aren’t less secure than their monolithic predecessor.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I outline some of the key challenges associated with microservice architectures with respect to security, and then looks at approaches to address these issues. From secret stores, time-limited credentials and better backups, to confused deputy problems, JWT tokens and service meshes, this talk looks at the state of the art for building secure microservice architectures.",

Sure, we've always had *some* ability to use dynamic code in .Net, but the existing techniques were either slow (Reflection) or daunting to use (IL generation or Expressions). Now though, we can just use C# in a way that's both more approachable for more developers and lends itself to more ambitious levels of dynamic behavior. In this talk I'll show some of the ways I've been using this technique to create more efficient, low allocation application frameworks. We'll also dive into the Utf8Json library already uses this approach today in its support for very highly efficient Json parsing.",

From the F# perspective, this fits with the default non-nullness of other F# types. But compatibility with existing code makes designing this a wild ride indeed! In this talk, we'll briefly explain what nullability means for F#, some existing mitigations for null in the language, and how we must consider compatibility with everything in mind. This deep dive into language design should give you an idea about what it is like designing a nontrivial feature that improves existing code while remaining compatible with it.",

Few people like \"programming\" YAML or JSON (even the human-friendly variants!), and even fewer like having to reverse-engineer ways to apply known good development practices to tools which resist it at all cost.\r\n\r\nSo, what if things were different,and programming infrastructure was more like real programming, with real programming languages like TypeScript? What if you defined Lambda functions by actually writing lambdas, created abstractions using complex types, and could take advantage of existing tools for modularity, linting, refactoring and testing?\r\n\r\nEnter Pulumi, an open-source deployment engine which enables all these things using TypeScript, Python or Go!\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll look at how you can write TypeScript code using Pulumi to provision traditional cloud infrastructure, manage Kubernetes and build portable \"serverless\" applications - all with minimal YAML in sight! We'll look at deploying to multiple regions of the same cloud, and how to build abstractions allowing multi-cloud to be a reality.",

While the paper and subsequent talks provided great insight in the challenges of coordinating activities across entities in a single database, implementations were left as an exercise to the reader!\r\n\r\nFast forward to today, and now we have NoSQL databases, microservices, message queues and brokers, HTTP web services and more that don't (and shouldn't) support any kind of distributed transaction.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we'll look at how to implement coordination between non-transactional resources using Pat's paper as a guide, with examples in Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Service Bus, and Azure SQL Server. We'll look at a real-world example where a codebase assumed everything would be transactional and always succeed, but production proved us wrong! Finally, we'll look at advanced coordination workflows such as Sagas to achieve robust, scalable coordination across the enterprise.",

Are core domains just academic jargon that get in the way of shiny technical practices like event sourcing, or is understanding business core domains one of the key differentiators between high-performing delivery teams and the rest of us?\r\n\r\nLet’s go on an adventure and see if the big blue big and can help us in this brave new world.",

              "description": "We’ve all heard a lot in the last year about a new advancement in the world of CSS, called CSS Grid. Starting off at whispers, we’re now starting to hear it as a deafening roar as more and more developers write about it, talk about it, share it and start using it. In the world of front end, I see it everywhere I turn and am excited as I start to use it in my own projects.\r\n\r\nBut what does this new CSS specification mean for software developers, and why should you care about it? In the world of tech today, we can do so many amazing things and use whatever language we choose across a wide range of devices and platforms. Whether it’s the advent of React and React Native, or frameworks like Electron, it’s easier than ever to build one app that works on multiple platforms with the language we know and work with best. The ability to do this also expands to styling apps on any platform using CSS, and therefore being able to utilise the magical thing that is\r\nCSS Grid.\r\n\r\nThe reason CSS Grid is gaining so much attention, is because it’s a game changer for front end and layouts. With a few simple lines of code, we can now create imaginative, dynamic, responsive layouts (yep, I know that’s a lot of buzz words). While a lot of people are calling this the new ‘table layout’, grid gives us so much more, with the ability to spread cells across columns and rows to whatever size you choose, dictate which direction new items flow, allow cells to move around to fit in place and even tell certain cells exactly where they need to sit.\r\n\r\nWhile there is so much to worry about when developing an app, CSS Grid means that you can worry less about building the layout on the front end, and more about making sure the back end works well. Let me show you how the magic works.",

              "description": "We have traditionally built robust software systems by trying to avoid mistakes and by dodging failures when they occur in production or by testing parts of the system in isolation from one another. Modern methods and techniques take a very different approach based on resiliency, which promotes embracing failure instead of trying to avoid it. Resilient architectures enhance observability, leverage well-known patterns such as graceful degradation, timeouts and circuit breakers and embrace chaos engineering, a discipline that promotes breaking things on purpose in order to learn how to build more resilient systems. In this session, will review the most useful patterns for building resilient software systems and I will introduce chaos engineering methodology and especially show the audience how they can benefit from breaking things on purpose.",

And our decisions had lasting consequences. Deciding which problems were worth our time was foundational to our failure.\r\n\r\nJoin us for a retrospective of software systems at Jurassic Park. We’ll dig into case studies and explore our successes and failures. We’ll uncover the options, costs, and risks inherent in deciding what software to build, what to buy, and alternatives in between. We’ll explore the opportunity cost of building systems, the sustainability of open-source, and the risks of vendor lock-in.

That’s fine, but there’s no good reason to limit our industry to basically one language when so many powerful and mature alternate languages and programming platforms exist. Starting now, WebAssembly opens the floodgates to new choices, and one of the first realistic options may be .NET.\r\n \r\nBlazor is a new experimental web UI framework from the ASP.NET team that aims to brings .NET applications into all browsers (including mobile) via WebAssembly. It allows you to build true full-stack .NET applications, sharing code across server and client, with no need for transpilation or plugins.\r\n \r\nIn this talk I’ll demonstrate what you can do with Blazor today and how it works on the underlying WebAssembly runtime behind the scenes. You’ll see its modern, component-based architecture (inspired by modern SPA frameworks) at work as we use it to build a responsive client-side UI. I’ll cover both basic and advanced scenarios using Blazor’s components, router, DI system, JavaScript interop, and more.",

What seems like a simple requirement can quickly become complicated! Networks aren't reliable and services fail. Dealing with those inevitable facts and avoiding a cascading failure can be quite a challenge. In this talk, Steve will explore how we can build .NET Core applications that make HTTP requests and rely on downstream services, whilst remaining resilient and fault tolerant.\r\n\r\nThis session will focus on some of the improvements which have been released in .NET Core and ASP.NET Core 2.1, such as IHttpClientFactory and the new, more performant SocketHttpHandler. Steve will identify some HTTP anti-patterns and common mistakes and demonstrate how we can refactor existing code to use the new HttpClientFactory features.\r\n\r\nNext, Steve will demonstrate other HTTP tips and tricking, including Polly; a fantastic resilience and transient fault handling library which can be used to make your applications less prone to failure. When integrated with the Microsoft IHttpClientFactory; wrapping your HTTP calls in retries, timeouts and circuit-breakers has never been easier!\r\n\r\nIf you're building services which make HTTP calls, then this talk is for you!",

All of this changed as I put together the first two volumes of The Imposter's Handbook.\r\n\r\nI get to build a lot of fun things in my new position at Microsoft and I've been surprised at how often I use the things I've learned. Avoiding an obvious performance pitfall with Redis, for instance, because I understood the Big-O implications of the data structure I chose. Going back to ensure that a salt was added to a hash which stored sensitive data for an old client and, most importantly, discouraging a friend from trying to solve a problem that was very clearly NP-Complete.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I'll show you some of the fun things I've learned (like mod(%) and remainder being different things) and how I've applied them to the applications I create for my day job. You might know some of these concepts, or maybe you don't - either way: hopefully you'll leave with a few more tools under your belt to help you do your job better.has grown exponentially over the years, in both market size and developer frustration.\r\n \r\nIn this talk I will walk you through my first few months as an Azure Cloud Developer Engineer, tasked with getting to know Azure, from scratch, while building compelling applications with it.

Billions of people tuned in live to watch Apollo 11 land on the moon, but behind Armstrong’s ‘one small step’ lay a decade of astonishing innovation. The Apollo programme wasn’t just about aerospace engineering; it was also responsible for revolutionary new approaches in project management and quality control; new ways of thinking about testing strategies and communications - not to mention delivering a completely bespoke set of hardware and software components that would play a vital role at every stage of the programme.\r\n\r\nAs we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the moon landings, let’s take a look back at the technology, processes and practises behind the Apollo programme - and how many of those techniques are still relevant today. What is ‘all-up testing’, and how does it apply to modern software development? Who was the CAPCOM - and what can they teach us about product ownership? How do you manage a distributed team of nearly half a million people? How do you manage scope creep when you’re working to a hard deadline with the whole world watching you? And how DO you fly to the moon and back using a computer with less processing power than an Apple II?",

You should design your service so that even if it is subject to intermittent heavy loads, it continues to operate reliably. But how do you build such applications? And how do you deploy an application that scales dynamically? Kubernetes has a feature called autoscaler where instances of your applications are increased or decreased automatically based on metrics that you define.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, you’ll learn how to design, package & deploy reliable .NET applications to Kubernetes & decouple several components using a message broker. You will also learn how to set autoscaling rules to cope with an increasing influx of messages in the queue.",

We'll see how we can manage this without needing to compromise and use object oriented frameworks whilst also still integrating with the existing ASP.Net, JavaScript and React ecosystems. We'll consider how we can write backend applications using Saturn on top of ASP.Net, we'll look at how to run F# in the web browser with Fable and we'll cover how we can develop interactive web applications leveraging the benefits of functional programming.

            "description": "In recent years there has been a shift in the way websites and mobile apps are being built - moving to architectures with immutable models and virtual UIs - based on the MVU (model-view-update) pattern. This has lead to great new frameworks like ELM and React for web, and ReactNative for mobile.\r\n\r\nNow there is a new MVU framework for building mobile apps - Fabulous. It's a community-driven open source framework, combining the simplicity of an MVU framework, with 100% native API access for both iOS and Android, all built with using an established, world class, battle-hardened functional programming language.\r\n\r\nThis session will start with an overview of MVU, discussing how it works and why it is such a great architecture. It will then move on to building your first Fabulous app that runs on iOS and Android. Next up more features will be added to the app whilst the app is running on a device, showing the hot reload capabilities of Fabulous for both UI and app logic. Finally it will look at the underlying architecture, see how to use all of the iOS and Android APIs, see how to easily use native components such as cocoa pods or jars, and look at the massive range of libraries that this framework as available to it to do all manner of UI and application logic things. We'll even see how to use it on macOS and Windows, including being able to build iOS apps on Windows (with the help of a networked Mac, Apple licensing rules and whatnot).\r\n\r\nWhen looking at naming for this framework, someone suggested Fabulous. By the end of this session you will see why that name stuck.",

The basic rulebook, the PHB, clocks in at a solid 300 pages, and can be extended with multiple additional rule sets. This should come as no surprise to software engineers: this is, after all, documentation for a system that models a complex domain, and has been in use for over 40 years now, going through numerous redesigns over time.\r\n\r\nAs such, D&D rules make for a great exercise in domain modelling. In this talk, I will take you along my journey attempting to tame that monster. We will use no magic, but a weapon imbued with great power, F#; practical tips and tricks for the Adventurer on the functional road will be shared.

            "description": "When we move from a monolith to microservices we abandon integrating via a shared database, as each service must own its own data to allow them it to be autonomous. But now we have a new problem, our data is distributed. What happens if I need one service needs to talk to another about a shared concept such as a product, a hotel room, or an order? Does every service need to have a list of all our users? Who knows what users have permissions to the entities within the micro service? What happens if my REST endpoint needs to include data from a graph that includes other services to make it responsive? And I am not breaking the boundary of my service when all of this data leaves my service boundary in response to a request?\r\n\r\nNaive solutions result in chatty calls as each service engages with multiple other services to fulfil a request, or in large message payloads as services add all the data required to process a message to each message. Neither scale well.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Pat Helland wrote a paper ‘Data on the Inside vs. Data on the Outside’ which answers the question by distinguishing between data a service owns and reference data that it can use. In this presentation we will explain reference data, how it is classified, and how it should be implemented. We will include a discussion of using reference data from ATOM feeds, discrete messaging and event streams. We’ll provide examples in C#, Python and Go as well as using RMQ and Kafka.",

Especially since Bob Wheel Sr. perfected that invention many, many years ago. And it's the same with software. Smart people have already encountered a lot of the problems that we face every day while building software. Some of them have even been nice enough to write down their solutions in so called \"patterns\". So why not stand on the shoulders of...well...maybe not giants...but at least very smart people who were born before you, and build on top of their hard-earned wisdom?\r\nThis session, will walk you through a bunch of really useful patterns, and you'll not only learn their names, but also why they are useful and how to implement them in .NET. And maybe, just maybe, you'll even see that one pattern that solves that problem you are working on at the moment. But even if you don't see that one pattern that you need, you will at least get a few that you can store in your toolbelt for future problems.\r\n",

While there have been various attempts to dethrone it, they have typically involved treating JavaScript as an assembly-language analog that you transpile your code to. This has lead to complex build pipelines that result in JavaScript which the browser has to parse and *you* still have to debug. But what if there were an actual byte-code language you could compile your non-JavaScript code to instead? That is what WebAssembly is.\r\n\r\nI'm going to explain how WebAssembly works and how to use it in this talk. I'll cover what it is, how it fits into your application, and how to build and use your own WebAssembly modules. And, I'll demo how to build and use those modules with both Rust and the WebAssembly Text Format. That's right, I'll be live coding in an assembly language. I'll also go over some online resources for other languages and tools that make use of WebAssembly.\r\n\r\nWhen we're done, you'll have the footing you need to start building applications featuring WebAssembly. So grab a non-JavaScript language, a modern browser, and let's and get started!",

With Polly, the .NET resilience framework, your application can easily tolerate transient faults and longer outages in remote systems or infrastructure. \r\n\r\nAt the end of this hour you will know how to use all the features of Polly to make your application a rock solid piece of work. We’ll cover the reactive and proactive resilience strategies, starting with simple but very powerful retries and finishing with bulkhead isolation.\r\nOh, and did I mention Polly is a .NET Standard library so it will work on any application you can think of!

Let me tell you more… \r\n\r\nAlmost all applications now depend on connectivity, but what do you do when the infrastructure is unreliable or the remote system is down or returns an error? Does your application grind to a halt or just drop that single request? What if you could recover from these kinds of error, maybe even so quickly it won’t be noticed? \r\n \r\nWith Polly your application can easily tolerate transient faults and longer outages in remote systems or infrastructure.  \r\n\r\nAt the end of this hour you will know how to use all the features of Polly to make your application a rock solid piece of work. \r\n\r\nWe’ll start with the simple but very powerful Retry Policy which lets you retry a failed request. If simple retries are not good enough for you, there is a Wait and Retry policy which introduces a delay between retries, giving the remote service time to recover before being hit again. Then I show you how to use the circuit breaker for when things have really gone wrong and a remote system is struggling under too much load or has failed. If all these attempts are unsuccessful and you are still not getting through to the remote system, you can return a default response or execute arbitrary code to call for human help (or restart the cloud) with the fallback policy. \r\n\r\nThat takes care of what you can do when things go wrong, but Polly also lets you take proactive steps to keep your application and the services it depends on healthy.  \r\n\r\nTo get you started with proactive strategies, you will learn how caching can be used to store and return responses from an in-memory or distributed cache without having to hit the remote server every time. Or you can use bulkhead isolation to marshal resources within your application so that no one struggling part can take down the whole. Finally, I’ll show you how to fail quickly when your application is in danger of being overloaded or the remote systems is not responding in a timely fashion, this is done with the bulkhead isolation and the timeout polices.   \r\n\r\nOh, and did I mention Polly is a .NET Standard library so it will work on any application you can think of! Join me for an hour, and your applications will never be the same. ",

All of this changed as I put together the first two volumes of The Imposter's Handbook.\r\n\r\nI get to build a lot of fun things in my new position at Microsoft and I've been surprised at how often I use the things I've learned. Avoiding an obvious performance pitfall with Redis, for instance, because I understood the Big-O implications of the data structure I chose. Going back to ensure that a salt was added to a hash which stored sensitive data for an old client and, most importantly, discouraging a friend from trying to solve a problem that was very clearly NP-Complete.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I'll show you some of the fun things I've learned (like mod(%) and remainder being different things) and how I've applied them to the applications I create for my day job.

Finally what should be alerted upon and how to avoid fatigue.\r\n\r\nTogether we will journey through a practical tour of dashboarding. Focusing on metrics, we will cover how to get information out of your applications using telemetry. I will show you how you might set up your monitoring infrastructure with a demo and talk through some hardened baselines. Finally, I’ll talk through a productionised setup including some gotchas to look out for.\r\n\r\nThis will be a whirlwind tour from start to finish of a practical guide to development dashboarding.

Especially since Bob Wheel Sr. perfected that invention many, many years ago. And it's the same with software. Smart people have already encountered a lot of the problems that we face every day while building software. Some of them have even been nice enough to write down their solutions in so called \"patterns\". So why not stand on the shoulders of...well...maybe not giants...but at least very smart people who were born before you, and build on top of their hard-earned wisdom?\r\nThis session, will walk you through a bunch of really useful patterns, and you'll not only learn their names, but also why they are useful and how to implement them in .NET. And maybe, just maybe, you'll even see that one pattern that solves that problem you are working on at the moment. But even if you don't see that one pattern that you need, you will at least get a few that you can store in your toolbelt for future problems.\r\n",

Starting now, WebAssembly opens the floodgates to new choices, and one of the first realistic options may be .NET.\r\n \r\nBlazor is a new experimental web UI framework from the ASP.NET team that aims to brings .NET applications into all browsers (including mobile) via WebAssembly. It allows you to build true full-stack .NET applications, sharing code across server and client, with no need for transpilation or plugins.\r\n \r\nIn this talk I’ll demonstrate what you can do with Blazor today and how it works on the underlying WebAssembly runtime behind the scenes. You’ll see its modern, component-based architecture (inspired by modern SPA frameworks) at work as we use it to build a responsive client-side UI. I’ll cover both basic and advanced scenarios using Blazor’s components, router, DI system, JavaScript interop, and more.",

              "description": "On July 20th, 1969, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to set foot on another world. Billions of people tuned in live to watch Apollo 11 land on the moon, but behind Armstrong’s ‘one small step’ lay a decade of astonishing innovation. The Apollo programme wasn’t just about aerospace engineering; it was also responsible for revolutionary new approaches in project management and quality control; new ways of thinking about testing strategies and communications - not to mention delivering a completely bespoke set of hardware and software components that would play a vital role at every stage of the programme.\r\n\r\nAs we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the moon landings, let’s take a look back at the technology, processes and practises behind the Apollo programme - and how many of those techniques are still relevant today. What is ‘all-up testing’, and how does it apply to modern software development? Who was the CAPCOM - and what can they teach us about product ownership? How do you manage a distributed team of nearly half a million people? How do you manage scope creep when you’re working to a hard deadline with the whole world watching you? And how DO you fly to the moon and back using a computer with less processing power than an Apple II?",

Kubernetes has a feature called autoscaler where instances of your applications are increased or decreased automatically based on metrics that you define.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, you’ll learn how to design, package & deploy reliable .NET applications to Kubernetes & decouple several components using a message broker.

This means not only learning multiple languages and frameworks but also having to support two different codebases for the same application. But Xamarin Native and Xamarin.Forms offer a powerful, cross-platform development solution for .NET developers looking to target smartphones, tablets, TV’s, computers and IoT devices.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, Luce shares what Xamarin is including Native and Xamarin.Forms for both C# and F#, how to get started creating a simple HelloWorld app from scratch and a more complex example (will involve at least one Azure service including Cognitive Services for facial recognition). Also how to use Visual Studio Team Services for Continuous Integration and some awesome examples of apps written using Xamarin including ones used to save lives!\r\n\r\nLuce will take examples from xamarin.com/customers as well as show this demo about how Xamarin was used alongside other technologies to aid with Skin Cancer prediction.\r\n\r\nThis talk will include slides, demos, code samples, live coding and the audience will walk away feeling like they too can create a mobile app in just a few minutes and carry their work around with them in their pocket or backpack!",

              "description": "In recent years there has been a shift in the way websites and mobile apps are being built - moving to architectures with immutable models and virtual UIs - based on the MVU (model-view-update) pattern. This has lead to great new frameworks like ELM and React for web, and ReactNative for mobile.\r\n\r\nNow there is a new MVU framework for building mobile apps - Fabulous. It's a community-driven open source framework, combining the simplicity of an MVU framework, with 100% native API access for both iOS and Android, all built with using an established, world class, battle-hardened functional programming language.\r\n\r\nThis session will start with an overview of MVU, discussing how it works and why it is such a great architecture. It will then move on to building your first Fabulous app that runs on iOS and Android. Next up more features will be added to the app whilst the app is running on a device, showing the hot reload capabilities of Fabulous for both UI and app logic. Finally it will look at the underlying architecture, see how to use all of the iOS and Android APIs, see how to easily use native components such as cocoa pods or jars, and look at the massive range of libraries that this framework as available to it to do all manner of UI and application logic things. We'll even see how to use it on macOS and Windows, including being able to build iOS apps on Windows (with the help of a networked Mac, Apple licensing rules and whatnot).\r\n\r\nWhen looking at naming for this framework, someone suggested Fabulous. By the end of this session you will see why that name stuck.",

While there have been various attempts to dethrone it, they have typically involved treating JavaScript as an assembly-language analog that you transpile your code to. This has lead to complex build pipelines that result in JavaScript which the browser has to parse and *you* still have to debug. But what if there were an actual byte-code language you could compile your non-JavaScript code to instead? That is what WebAssembly is.\r\n\r\nI'm going to explain how WebAssembly works and how to use it in this talk. I'll cover what it is, how it fits into your application, and how to build and use your own WebAssembly modules. And, I'll demo how to build and use those modules with both Rust and the WebAssembly Text Format. That's right, I'll be live coding in an assembly language. I'll also go over some online resources for other languages and tools that make use of WebAssembly.\r\n\r\nWhen we're done, you'll have the footing you need to start building applications featuring WebAssembly. So grab a non-JavaScript language, a modern browser, and let's and get started!",

With Polly, the .NET resilience framework, your application can easily tolerate transient faults and longer outages in remote systems or infrastructure. \r\n\r\nAt the end of this hour you will know how to use all the features of Polly to make your application a rock solid piece of work.

Let me tell you more… \r\n\r\nAlmost all applications now depend on connectivity, but what do you do when the infrastructure is unreliable or the remote system is down or returns an error? Does your application grind to a halt or just drop that single request? What if you could recover from these kinds of error, maybe even so quickly it won’t be noticed? \r\n \r\nWith Polly your application can easily tolerate transient faults and longer outages in remote systems or infrastructure.  \r\n\r\nAt the end of this hour you will know how to use all the features of Polly to make your application a rock solid piece of work. \r\n\r\nWe’ll start with the simple but very powerful Retry Policy which lets you retry a failed request. If simple retries are not good enough for you, there is a Wait and Retry policy which introduces a delay between retries, giving the remote service time to recover before being hit again. Then I show you how to use the circuit breaker for when things have really gone wrong and a remote system is struggling under too much load or has failed. If all these attempts are unsuccessful and you are still not getting through to the remote system, you can return a default response or execute arbitrary code to call for human help (or restart the cloud) with the fallback policy. \r\n\r\nThat takes care of what you can do when things go wrong, but Polly also lets you take proactive steps to keep your application and the services it depends on healthy.  \r\n\r\nTo get you started with proactive strategies, you will learn how caching can be used to store and return responses from an in-memory or distributed cache without having to hit the remote server every time. Or you can use bulkhead isolation to marshal resources within your application so that no one struggling part can take down the whole. Finally, I’ll show you how to fail quickly when your application is in danger of being overloaded or the remote systems is not responding in a timely fashion, this is done with the bulkhead isolation and the timeout polices.   \r\n\r\nOh, and did I mention Polly is a .NET Standard library so it will work on any application you can think of! Join me for an hour, and your applications will never be the same. ",

What seems like a simple requirement can quickly become complicated! Networks aren't reliable and services fail. Dealing with those inevitable facts and avoiding a cascading failure can be quite a challenge. In this talk, Steve will explore how we can build .NET Core applications that make HTTP requests and rely on downstream services, whilst remaining resilient and fault tolerant.\r\n\r\nThis session will focus on some of the improvements which have been released in .NET Core and ASP.NET Core 2.1, such as IHttpClientFactory and the new, more performant SocketHttpHandler. Steve will identify some HTTP anti-patterns and common mistakes and demonstrate how we can refactor existing code to use the new HttpClientFactory features.\r\n\r\nNext, Steve will demonstrate other HTTP tips and tricking, including Polly; a fantastic resilience and transient fault handling library which can be used to make your applications less prone to failure. When integrated with the Microsoft IHttpClientFactory; wrapping your HTTP calls in retries, timeouts and circuit-breakers has never been easier!\r\n\r\nIf you're building services which make HTTP calls, then this talk is for you!",

The basic rulebook, the PHB, clocks in at a solid 300 pages, and can be extended with multiple additional rule sets. This should come as no surprise to software engineers: this is, after all, documentation for a system that models a complex domain, and has been in use for over 40 years now, going through numerous redesigns over time.\r\n\r\nAs such, D&D rules make for a great exercise in domain modelling. In this talk, I will take you along my journey attempting to tame that monster. We will use no magic, but a weapon imbued with great power, F#; practical tips and tricks for the Adventurer on the functional road will be shared. So... roll 20 for initiative, and join us for an epic adventure in domain modeling with F#!",

              "description": "When we move from a monolith to microservices we abandon integrating via a shared database, as each service must own its own data to allow them it to be autonomous. But now we have a new problem, our data is distributed. What happens if I need one service needs to talk to another about a shared concept such as a product, a hotel room, or an order? Does every service need to have a list of all our users? Who knows what users have permissions to the entities within the micro service? What happens if my REST endpoint needs to include data from a graph that includes other services to make it responsive? And I am not breaking the boundary of my service when all of this data leaves my service boundary in response to a request?\r\n\r\nNaive solutions result in chatty calls as each service engages with multiple other services to fulfil a request, or in large message payloads as services add all the data required to process a message to each message. Neither scale well.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Pat Helland wrote a paper ‘Data on the Inside vs. Data on the Outside’ which answers the question by distinguishing between data a service owns and reference data that it can use. In this presentation we will explain reference data, how it is classified, and how it should be implemented. We will include a discussion of using reference data from ATOM feeds, discrete messaging and event streams. We’ll provide examples in C#, Python and Go as well as using RMQ and Kafka.",

On my first day I was given a Wyse 60 terminal attached via RS232 cables to a Tandon 286, and told to learn C from a dead tree so I could write text applications for an 80x24 character screen. Fast-forward to now: my phone is about a million times more powerful than that Tandon; screens are 3840x2160 pixels; every computer in the world is attached to every other thing with no cables; and we code using, well, still basically C.\r\n\r\nHaving lived through all those changes in realtime, and as an incurable neophile, I think I can make an educated guess as to what the next 30 years are going to be like, and what we're all going to be doing by 2049. If anything, I'm going to underestimate it, but hopefully you'll be inspired, invigorated and maybe even informed about the future of your career in tech.",

            "description": "The world runs on legacy code. For every greenfield progressive web app with 100% test coverage, there are literally hundreds of archaic line-of-business applications running in production - systems with no tests, no documentation, built using out-of-date tools, languages and platforms. It’s the code developers love to hate: it’s not exciting, it’s not shiny, and it won’t look good on your CV - but the world runs on legacy code, and, as developers, if we’re going to work on anything that actually matters, we’re going to end up dealing with legacy. To work effectively with this kind of system, we need to answer some fundamental questions: why was it built this way in the first place? What's happened over the years it's been running in production? And, most importantly, how can we develop our understanding of legacy codebases to the point where we're confident that we can add features, fix bugs and improve performance without making things worse?\r\n\r\nDylan worked on the web application stack at Spotlight (www.spotlight.com) from 2000 until 2018 - first as a supplier, then as webmaster, then as systems architect. Working on the same codebase for nearly two decades has given him an unusual perspective on how applications go from being cutting-edge to being 'legacy'. In this talk, he'll share tips, patterns and techniques that he's learned from helping new developers work with a large and unfamiliar codebase. We'll talk about virtualisation, refactoring tools, and how to bring legacy code under control using continuous integration and managed deployments. We'll explore creative ways to use common technologies like DNS to create more productive development environments. We'll talk about how to bridge the gap between automated testing and systems monitoring, how to improve visibility and transparency of your production systems - and why good old Ctrl-Alt-Del might be the secret to unlocking the potential of your legacy codebase.",

We’ll look at the fantastic Visual Studio integration and how easily the two editors work together.\r\n\r\nFinally we’ll look at the ways in which we can give our 3D experience some polish by adding textures, animations and some explosions!\r\n\r\nKeeping the best news for last: Unity is royalty free until you’re earning $100,000 – so if you like the idea of becoming wildly rich from making immersive 3D experiences this is the talk for you.",

On the ever-evolving web accessibility is a matter of ongoing importance: the brilliance of your code or sleekness of your UI is inconsequential if your app or website is unusable to some of your users. With a million other issues already on your plate how do you find a way to get started on accessibility testing? Pa11y to the rescue! Pa11y is a lightweight command-line accessibility testing tool with enough flexibility to integrate results into your current testing process. This talk will explain what pa11y does and does not cover, review examples of both command line and scripted usage, dive into the pa11y web service and show how to modify output to work in your current testing setup. Bonus content: how to convince the rest of your team and business why accessibility is worth prioritizing and how getting started with low-hanging fruit can vastly improve your product.",

            "description": "\r\nWhile Java has grown enormously over the years, the fundamentals have stagnated.\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this talk and underlying project, was the following question: why is Java, with it’s 20 years of age, and (at least)6 billion running JVM’s not a major player in the video-game development universe?\r\n\r\n#####TL;DR;\r\nSo everybody knows the Doom games, right? Every new installment brought brand new ideas, and groundbreaking graphics. But more importantly, they brought the source code of the prior installment to the public eye.\r\n\r\nNaturally people have played and hacked the code to oblivion, as much as they played the games themselves. And I have the honor to be one of those people.\r\n\r\nI (naively) endeavored to port the Doom 3 C++ code to the fantabulous Java. In doing so, I hoped to learn, among other things, more about 3D graphics.\r\n...what I didn't expect though, was for djoom3(cool name huh!) to teach me more about Java!?\r\n\r\nAside from the basic game development intro, this talk focuses on the following:\r\n- Some areas where Java should learn from it's nemesis, C++\r\n- Other areas where the student(Java) becomes the master(C++)\r\n- And some promises that were made, but never keptWhile Ja",

Imagine you could control that backbone independently of all the components, so your application code just makes simple calls to other services, and your communication backbone does all the complex non-functional work. Load balancing, traffic management, fault tolerance, end-to-end monitoring, dynamic routing and secure communication could all be applied and controlled centrally. That's a service mesh.\r\n\r\nIn this session I'll cover the major features of a service mesh using Istio - which is the most popular technology in this space. I'll show you what you can do with a service mesh, how it simplifies application design and also where it adds complexity. My examples will range from new microservices designs to legacy monoliths, and you'll see what a service mesh can bring to different types of application.",

Being a close friend of the family, I started looking around the web after seeing news reports of home-made devices.  I stumbled across the OpenBionics team and the great work they do and set to building a version for Kayden.  \r\nAfter 3D printing the parts I moved onto the electronics but this requires building a bespoke board that often needs software changes to set-up and configure.  So my version uses off the shelf IOT parts and connects via Bluetooth to a Xamarin .Net application for changing the settings and configuring on Kayden’s phone. Still a work in progress but I will talk about the process used to get this far and how I have hopefully reduced the costs even more from a few hundred to around £80 for future hands and plan to give back to the opensource project.",

              "description": "The world runs on legacy code. For every greenfield progressive web app with 100% test coverage, there are literally hundreds of archaic line-of-business applications running in production - systems with no tests, no documentation, built using out-of-date tools, languages and platforms. It’s the code developers love to hate: it’s not exciting, it’s not shiny, and it won’t look good on your CV - but the world runs on legacy code, and, as developers, if we’re going to work on anything that actually matters, we’re going to end up dealing with legacy. To work effectively with this kind of system, we need to answer some fundamental questions: why was it built this way in the first place? What's happened over the years it's been running in production? And, most importantly, how can we develop our understanding of legacy codebases to the point where we're confident that we can add features, fix bugs and improve performance without making things worse?\r\n\r\nDylan worked on the web application stack at Spotlight (www.spotlight.com) from 2000 until 2018 - first as a supplier, then as webmaster, then as systems architect. Working on the same codebase for nearly two decades has given him an unusual perspective on how applications go from being cutting-edge to being 'legacy'. In this talk, he'll share tips, patterns and techniques that he's learned from helping new developers work with a large and unfamiliar codebase. We'll talk about virtualisation, refactoring tools, and how to bring legacy code under control using continuous integration and managed deployments. We'll explore creative ways to use common technologies like DNS to create more productive development environments. We'll talk about how to bridge the gap between automated testing and systems monitoring, how to improve visibility and transparency of your production systems - and why good old Ctrl-Alt-Del might be the secret to unlocking the potential of your legacy codebase.",

Every new installment brought brand new ideas, and groundbreaking graphics. But more importantly, they brought the source code of the prior installment to the public eye.\r\n\r\nNaturally people have played and hacked the code to oblivion, as much as they played the games themselves. And I have the honor to be one of those people.\r\n\r\nI (naively) endeavored to port the Doom 3 C++ code to the fantabulous Java. In doing so, I hoped to learn, among other things, more about 3D graphics.\r\n...what I didn't expect though, was for djoom3(cool name huh!) to teach me more about Java!?\r\n\r\nAside from the basic game development intro, this talk focuses on the following:\r\n- Some areas where Java should learn from it's nemesis, C++\r\n- Other areas where the student(Java) becomes the master(C++)\r\n- And some promises that were made, but never keptWhile Ja",

Load balancing, traffic management, fault tolerance, end-to-end monitoring, dynamic routing and secure communication could all be applied and controlled centrally. That's a service mesh.\r\n\r\nIn this session I'll cover the major features of a service mesh using Istio - which is the most popular technology in this space. I'll show you what you can do with a service mesh, how it simplifies application design and also where it adds complexity. My examples will range from new microservices designs to legacy monoliths, and you'll see what a service mesh can bring to different types of application.",

They’re now incorporated into our phones, our laptops, and even available as separate devices in our homes. Some people haven’t adopted them out of privacy concerns. A new system called Mycroft has come onto the scene, and it’s built on open source hardware and software. You can install it on a Raspberry Pi, an old Linux box, or buy their own Mycroft device.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we’ll go over the basics of what Mycroft is, and how you can quickly install it yourself. From there, we’ll talk about some of the underlying software and see a short demo. Finally, we’ll see how to build a new skill into it and contribute it back to the community. You’ll leave with your own virtual assistant and the knowledge on how make it do what you want but keep your privacy in check.",

I will tell you a story of a mysterious correlation - from the StackOverflow developer survey it seems that developers who use spaces have higher salaries than those who use tabs. Correlation doesn't mean causation: using spaces won't suddenly increase your salary. But what does it all mean? Follow me into a detective investigation that will show you how to approach complex data science problems. I will show you some of the perils of correlation, model fitting and biases - how they can be dangerous and how to avoid these traps. And you'll also find how profitable your indentation style really is.",

Being a close friend of the family, I started looking around the web after seeing news reports of home-made devices.  I stumbled across the OpenBionics team and the great work they do and set to building a version for Kayden.  \r\nAfter 3D printing the parts I moved onto the electronics but this requires building a bespoke board that often needs software changes to set-up and configure.  So my version uses off the shelf IOT parts and connects via Bluetooth to a Xamarin .Net application for changing the settings and configuring on Kayden’s phone. Still a work in progress but I will talk about the process used to get this far and how I have hopefully reduced the costs even more from a few hundred to around £80 for future hands and plan to give back to the opensource project.",

On my first day I was given a Wyse 60 terminal attached via RS232 cables to a Tandon 286, and told to learn C from a dead tree so I could write text applications for an 80x24 character screen. Fast-forward to now: my phone is about a million times more powerful than that Tandon; screens are 3840x2160 pixels; every computer in the world is attached to every other thing with no cables; and we code using, well, still basically C.\r\n\r\nHaving lived through all those changes in realtime, and as an incurable neophile, I think I can make an educated guess as to what the next 30 years are going to be like, and what we're all going to be doing by 2049. If anything, I'm going to underestimate it, but hopefully you'll be inspired, invigorated and maybe even informed about the future of your career in tech.",

But is it, really?\r\n\r\nAfter all, why are there three different kinds of rebase?  What makes merge recursive?  And what's the deal with line ending normalization?  Edward Thomson shows off some of the weirder idiosyncrasies in Git and why it works the way it does.",
