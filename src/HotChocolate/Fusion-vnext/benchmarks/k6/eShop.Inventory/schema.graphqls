"""
The @internal directive is used in combination with lookup fields and allows you
to declare internal types and fields. Internal types and fields do not appear in
the final client-facing composite schema and do not participate in the standard
schema-merging process. This allows a source schema to define lookup fields for
resolving entities that should not be accessible through the client-facing
composite schema.
