/// The <c>@override</c> directive designates that ownership of a field is transferred from one

/// implement the interface are responsible for providing the actual fields. Consequently, it is
/// invalid to attach <c>@override</c> directly to an interface field. Doing so leads to an
/// <c>OVERRIDE_ON_INTERFACE</c> error because there is no concrete field implementation on the
/// interface itself that can be overridden.
