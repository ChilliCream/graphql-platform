/// <code>
/// directive @shareable repeatable on FIELD_DEFINITION | OBJECT
/// </code>
///
/// The @shareable directive indicates that given object and/or field can be resolved by multiple subgraphs.
/// If an object is marked as @shareable then all its fields are automatically shareable without the need
/// for explicitly marking them with @shareable directive. All fields referenced from @key directive are
/// automatically shareable as well.
/// <example>
/// type Foo @key(fields: "id") {
///   id: ID!                           # shareable because id is a key field
///   name: String                      # non-shareable
///   description: String @shareable    # shareable
/// }
///
/// type Bar @shareable {
///   description: String               # shareable because User is marked shareable
///   name: String                      # shareable because User is marked shareable
/// }
