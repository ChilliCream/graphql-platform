"The `@defer` directive may be provided for fragment spreads and inline fragments to inform the executor to delay the execution of the current fragment to indicate deprioritization of the current fragment. A query with `@defer` directive will cause the request to potentially return multiple responses, where non-deferred data is delivered in the initial response and data deferred is delivered in a subsequent response. `@include` and `@skip` take precedence over `@defer`."

"The `@stream` directive may be provided for a field of `List` type so that the backend can leverage technology such as asynchronous iterators to provide a partial list in the initial response, and additional list items in subsequent responses. `@include` and `@skip` take precedence over `@stream`."
