"""
By default, only a single source schema is allowed to contribute
a particular field to an object type.

            
This prevents source schemas from inadvertently defining similarly named
fields that are not semantically equivalent.

            
Fields must be explicitly marked as @shareable to allow multiple source
schemas to define them, ensuring that the decision to serve a field from
more than one source schema is intentional and coordinated.
