/// GraphQL Unions represent an object that could be one of a list of GraphQL Object types,
/// but provides for no guaranteed fields between those types.

/// They also differ from interfaces in that Object types declare what interfaces
/// they implement, but are not aware of what unions contain them.
/// </para>

/// With interfaces and objects, only those fields defined on the type can be queried directly;
/// to query other fields on an interface, typed fragments must be used.
/// This is the same as for unions, but unions do not define any fields,
/// so no fields may be queried on this type without the use of type refining
/// fragments or inline fragments (with the exception of the meta-field __typename).
/// </para>

/// <code>
/// union SearchResult = Photo | Person
///
/// type Person {
///   name: String
///   age: Int

///
/// type Photo {
///   height: Int
///   width: Int
