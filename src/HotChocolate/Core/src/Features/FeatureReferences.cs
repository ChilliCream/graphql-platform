    // Careful with modifications to the Fetch method; it is carefully constructed for inlining

    // This method is 59 IL bytes and at inline call depth 3 from accessing a property.
    // This combination is enough for the jit to consider it an "unprofitable inline"
    // Aggressively inlining it causes the entire call chain to dissolve:
    //
    // This means this call graph:
    //
    // HttpResponse.Headers -> Response.HttpResponseFeature -> Fetch -> Fetch      -> Revision
    //                                                               -> Collection -> Collection

    //
    // HttpResponse.Headers -> Collection.Revision
    //                      -> UpdateCached (not called on fast path)
    //
    // As this is inlined at the callsite we want to keep the method small, so it only detects
    // if a reset or update is required and all the reset and update logic is pushed to UpdateCached.
    //
    // Generally Fetch is called at a ratio > x4 of UpdateCached so this is a large gain
